The Following is a breakdown of the code I developed in my artificial intelligence class</br>
  
  The first program (PA_1) are implementations of different search algorithms (bfs, dfs, etc.) that were used to solve the chicken and wolves river riddle. Below is a sample of running the program using dfs. The individual steps are printed out showing a solution to the problem</br>

  The second program (PA_2) is an implementaiton of the othello game. For this I programed the minimax algorithm that the player can try and play against. The rest of the code was given to us by our professor. Blow is an example of what the game looks like when playing against my algorithm</br>
