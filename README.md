## Artificial Intelligence Programs
The Following is a breakdown of the code I developed in my artificial intelligence class</br>
  
 ## Searching Algorithms
  The first program (PA_1) are implementations of different search algorithms (bfs, dfs, etc.) that were used to solve the chicken and wolves river riddle. Below is a sample of running the program using bfs. The individual steps are printed out showing a solution to the problem</br>

## Minimax Aglorithm
  The second program (PA_2) is an implementaiton of the othello game. For this I programed the minimax algorithm that the player can try and play against. The rest of the code was given to us by our professor. Below is an example of what the game looks like when playing against my algorithm</br>

## Niave Bayes
  The last program (PA_3) is an implementation of a Niave Bayes program that reads in a pretend email and classifies it as spam or not spam. Files are provided in the foulder that are used as the training and testing set. Examples of some of the emails from both sets are included as well as the predictions for which class it will be in. Note that the log of these values are taken to account for the small probabilities so they are not percentages. Class zero represents the spam emails and class one represents not spam. The top accuracy in the picture below is accuracy on the training set and the second accuracy reported is the accuracy on the testing set</br>
